# Style Guide and Naming Documentation

## C\# File naming

Files should follow the camel case naming convention. Where the begining of the
first word is lowercase and any new word that follows is capitalized.

Example:
```
thisIsAExampleFile.cs
```

## C\# Variable naming

Variable naming should follow the same convention as file naming.

The begining of the first word in a variable name should be lowercase and any new
word that follows should be capitalized.

Example:
```cs
private float thisIsAExampleVariable;
```
